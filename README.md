## Ran out of time to implement these

## Frontend Trade-offs /  Questions / Improvements
1. Materials list pagination/scrolling.
1. Accessibility of the form.
1. Form validation.
1. Authentication/Authorization.
1. CSS could be improved/made more modular/responsive.
1. Didn't spend time on adding the icons for `delete` & `add` materials buttons.
1. The form (CSS) could be aligned better/made pixel perfect as per design.
1. Currency should be formatted.
